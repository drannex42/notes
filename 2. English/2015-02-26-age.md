I believe the age is different for each person. The age that their nature changes (if at all) is different due to the environment they live in, the circumstances they have to go through, and the genetic structure that you are given from their parents. For example, two identical brothers are put up for adoption and adopted by two completely different families. Due to how each family treats their new son they will be different. One could be more open to peace, ant-discrimination, and a zen-like nature all their life due to how the family they lived with treated them, and the other son could become an abusive racist drug addict who lives off of the adrenaline high of doing a numerous amount of illegal things. Due to the environment they were brought up the age that our inherit nature could change would be drastically different.
